# grinding_rust
Repository to hold my work as I learn Rust. Will be reading their book they provide online (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) and following their guides and projects.

If I decide to work on some of my own ideas for projects I may decide to include them in this repo or make their own depending on the size. Feel free to glance at my journey or join me!

* Hello World
    * First project everyone does. No build tools, or pipelines, just print that text in the console!
